# fitness-journal

My attempt to create a journal-type application to track my fitness- and nutritional journey.

## Minimum viable product

### First Stage

Blog-Post-Style first draft, documenting thoughts and experiences on certain dates.

### Second Stage

Adding mechanics to note down learnings in a bullet-point-style manner, ordered by general learnings, learnings in regards to fat-loss / maintenance / bulking, and maybe training styles.

### Third stage

Visualizing progress like weightgain/-loss and training-progress.
